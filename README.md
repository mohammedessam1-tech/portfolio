## 🔧 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Add a real form backend** — connect to Formspree, EmailJS, or Web3Forms to handle form submissions without opening the email client
2. **Add real project screenshots** — replace gradient icon placeholders with actual website screenshots
3. **Add Open Graph tags** — for better social sharing previews
4. **Performance** — for production, use the Tailwind CLI to purge unused classes
5. **Add Google Analytics** — track visitor behavior
6. **Add a Blog section** — share insights on e-commerce and AI tools
